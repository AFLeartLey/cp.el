* acm.el

acm.el (or, ~acm-mode~) provides a minor mode to assist in competitive
programming, by saving you from tedious tasks like
+ building the program
+ feeding input
+ getting output
+ measuring running time (todo)
+ comparing your results with correct results (todo)

Yes, these tasks are trivial, but it can be really annoying.

*NOTE:* this is in early development, and your improvements are
welcome.  Since I'm an Emacs Lisp beginner, you are encouraged to
review my code and make it better.

** Installation

Since this package is not yet ready for public use, there's no better
way but ~load~.
